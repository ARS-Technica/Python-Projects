# PyRex Regular Expression Editor

The goal of this project is to better familarize myself
with both Python's Tkinter and Regular Expression libraries.

Once finished, this project will allow users to text regular
expressions on a test bed of sample text while simultaneously
offering a cheatsheet of common regex expressions and 
storage for a rolodex of their the most useful regex snippets.

This code will eventually be integrated into my larger Advanced 
Text Editor project as an advanced RegEx search function.
