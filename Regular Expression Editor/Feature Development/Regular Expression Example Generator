Regular Expression Example Generator

A collection of functions that will eventually be incorporated into
the larger Regular Expression Editor, first as functions, then as a
class.

The purpose of these functions is to return an example of a text string
that a simple regular expression entered by the user might find if 
applied to a document.

Input: A regular expression (Str)
Output: A text example (Str

    Automatically generate a sample if the sample input box is empty.

    - Reads the regex pattern from the regex_input text widget.
    - Checks the sample_input text widget.
    - If sample_input is empty and a regex is provided, generates one or more
        sample strings using `generate_samples_from_regex`.
    - Inserts the generated sample(s) into the sample_input widget.
