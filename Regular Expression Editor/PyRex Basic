"""
The goal of this project is to better familarize myself
with both Python's Tkinter and Regular Expression libraries.

Once finished, this project will allow users to text regular
expressions on a text bed of sample text while simultaneously
offering a cheatsheet of common regex expressions and 
storage for a rolodex of their the most useful regex snippets.
