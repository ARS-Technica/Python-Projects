Having abandoned my attempt to create a Wordpad clone due to a lack of updated
.rtf libraries for Python 3.x, I now need to rethink how I will be styling the
text in my Tkinter text widget in such a way that it can still be easily converted
to a .docx file format with a straightforward function.  This code is my testbed
for creating that code without metaphorcially ripping up the floorboards on my 
current Notepad project.
