"""
The following is a test bed for adding the ability
to save file in a rich text format using Python.
Hopefully, this code will eventually be merged into
the Notebook Text Editor I'm creating with Tkinter.

Note: Python libraries for handling Rich Text files
are neither well maintained nor well documented.

# Open the .txt file

    # Read the contents of the file
    text = f.read()

# Create a new RTF document
doc = PyRTF.Document()

# Add the text to the document
doc.add_text(text)

# Save the document as an RTF file
output_file_path = "my_file.rtf"
