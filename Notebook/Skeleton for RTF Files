The following is a test bed for adding the ability
to save file in a rich text format using Python.
Hopefully, this code will eventually be merged into
the Notebook Text Editor I'm creating with Tkinter.

Note: Python libraries for handling Rich Text files
are neither well maintained nor well documented.
