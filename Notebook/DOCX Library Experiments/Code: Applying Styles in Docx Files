"""
To bold a word, you can first create a Run object for the word, and then set 
the bold property to True. For example, the following code would bold the word 
"hello" in a paragraph:
"""

from docx import Document

document = Document()

paragraph = document.add_paragraph()

run = paragraph.add_run("hello")
run.bold = True

document.save("bold_word.docx")


#%%

"""
You can also use the Run.bold property to toggle the bold formatting of a word.
For example, the following code would bold the word "hello" if it is not already
bold, and unbold it if it is already bold:
"""

from docx import Document

document = Document()

paragraph = document.add_paragraph()

run = paragraph.add_run("hello")
run.bold = not run.bold

document.save("toggle_bold_word.docx")


#%%

"""
You can also use the Run.bold property to apply bold formatting to a range of 
runs in a paragraph. For example, the following code would bold the first two 
runs in a paragraph:
"""
    
from docx import Document

document = Document()

paragraph = document.add_paragraph()

run1 = paragraph.add_run("hello")
run2 = paragraph.add_run("world")

run1.bold = True
run2.bold = True

document.save("bold_range_of_runs.docx")


#%%

"""
Apply both bold and italics to a particular word in python-docx
"""

import docx

word = 'Dictionary'

doc = docx.Document()
p = doc.add_paragraph()

runner = p.add_run(word)
runner.bold = True
runner.italic = True

doc.save('test.docx')
