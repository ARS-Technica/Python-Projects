"""
To bold a word, you can first create a Run object for the word, and then set 
the bold property to True. For example, the following code would bold the word 
"hello" in a paragraph:
"""

from docx import Document

document = Document()

paragraph = document.add_paragraph()

run = paragraph.add_run("hello")
run.bold = True

document.save("bold_word.docx")
