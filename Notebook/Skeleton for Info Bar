"""
The following code is an attempt to add an Info Bar to the existing Status Bar of my Notebook
project.  The Info Bar will display the current position of the cursor on the text widget in ther
format: Line: 1 | Column: 0

If successful, the Info Bar should appear at the bottom, right-most edge of the window on what
is currently the Status Bar.  It should toggle on and off with a check box in the Options Menu.
The Info Bar should also not interfere with the Search Bar.
"""


"""
Problem: Attempts to add additional labels to the Status Bar result in the Info Bar appearing next
to the text in the Status Bar label, rather than on the right-most side of the Status Bar.
